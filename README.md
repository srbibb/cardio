# cardio
This is an application which allows users to create flashcards which are saved to a file for later use. The user can then test themselves by selecting a deck of flashcards, and gain points for correct answers. These points can be used to compete with others users, as there is a leaderboard for each flashcard deck. This aims to motivate practise by competition.
